<h1> Announcements </h1> </br>
<p> 
We have some cool things happening that we want people to know about: this month you can purchase 3 drinks for the price of 2 at the bar.
First-time party-goers get a 50% discount on entry
If you get a costume custom made, your next party entry is free if you wear that costume.
Wear your costume in to KFC on Stanton street and you can get a free drink with a 21-piece bucket. Tell them youâ€™ve been to CossiePlay!
